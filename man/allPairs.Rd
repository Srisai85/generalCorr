\title{Report causal identification for all pairs of variables in a matrix.}
\usage{
allPairs(mtx, dig = 6, verbo = FALSE, typ = 1, rnam = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mtx}{{Input matrix with variable names}}

\item{dig}{{Digits of accuracy in reporting (=6, default)}}

\item{verbo}{{Logical variable, set to 'TRUE' if printing is desired}}

\item{typ}{{Causal direction criterion number (typ=1 is default)
Criterion 1 (Cr1) compares kernel regression absolute values of gradients.
Criterion 2 (Cr2) compares kernel regression absolute values of residuals.
Criterion 3 (Cr3) compares kernel regression based r*(x|y) with r*(y|x)}.}

\item{rnam}{{Logical variable, default \code{rnam=FALSE} means the user does
not want the row row names to be
(somewhat too cleverly) assigned by the function.}}
}
\value{
A 7-column matrix called 'outcause' with names of variables
 X and Y in the first two columns and the name of the 'causal' variable in 3rd col.
 Remaining four columns report numerical computations of SD1 to SD4, r*(x|y),
 r*(y|x).  Pearson r and p-values for its traditional significance testing.
}
\description{
This is a convenient way to study all possible (perhaps too many)
causal directions in a matrix. It calls
\code{abs_stdapd}, \code{abs_stdres}, \code{comp_portfo2}, etc. and returns
a matrix with 7 columns with detailed output.
}
\note{
The cause reported in the third column
 is identified from the sign of the first SD1 only,
 ignoring SD2, SD3 and SD4  under both Cr1 and Cr2. It is
 a good idea to loop a call to this function with typ=1:3. One can print
 the resulting 'outcause' matrix with the 
 \code{xtable(outcause)} for the Latex output.
 A similar (perhaps better) function included in this package,
  called \code{some0Pairs}, incorporates all SD1 to SD4 and all
 three criteria Cr1 rto Cr3 to report a `sum' of indexes representing the signed 
 number whose sign can more comprehensively help determine the causal direction(s).

\examples{

data(mtcars)
for(j in 1:3){
a1=allPairs(mtcars[,1:3], typ=j)
print(a1)}
