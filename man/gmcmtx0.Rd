\title{Compute the matrix R* of generalized correlation coefficients.}
\usage{
gmcmtx0(mym, nam = colnames(mym))
}
\arguments{
\item{mym}{{A matrix of data on variables in columns}}

\item{nam}{{Column names of the variables in the data matrix}}
}
\value{
A non-symmetric R* matrix of generalized correlation coefficients
}
\description{
This function checks for missing data separately for each pair. It then uses the
\code{kern} function to kernel regress x on y, and conversely y on x. It
 needs the library `np' which reports R-squares of each regression. This function
reports their square roots after assigning them the the sign of the Pearson 
correlation coefficients.
Its appeal is that it is asymmetric yielding causal direction information,
by relaxing the assumption of linearity implicit in usual correlation coefficients.
